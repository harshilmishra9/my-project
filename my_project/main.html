<h1 style="font-size:35px">About</h1>
<p align= justify>The MidDay Meal scheme could be a school meal programme in Bharat designed 
  to higher the nutritionary standing of school-age children nationwide.
  The programme provides free lunches on operating days for children in primary and higher 
  primary categories in government, government motor-assisted, local body, Education Guarantee theme, 
  and alternate innovative education centres, Madarsa and Maqtabs supported beneath 
  Sarva Shiksha Abhiyan, and National kid Labour Project faculties go by the ministry of labour.
  Serving a hundred and twenty million kids in over one.27 million faculties and Education Guarantee theme centres, 
  the noontide Meal theme is that the largest of its kind within the world.</p>

  <p align= justify>Mid Day Meal sceme has being enforced within the Union Territory of Puducherry beneath the 
  French Administration since 1930.In the post-independent Asian nation, noontide meal theme was 
  1st launched in state, pioneered by the previous Chief minister K. Kamaraj within the early 60s. 
  By 2002, the theme was enforced altogether of the states beneath the orders of the 
  Supreme Court of India</p>
  
  <p align= justify>The name of the theme has been modified to PM-POSHAN (Pradhan Mantri Poshan Sakti Nirman) theme, 
  in September 2021, by Ministry of Education, that is nodal ministry for the theme.
  The Central Government conjointly declared that a further twenty four hundred thousand students 
  receiving pre-primary education at government & government-aided faculties would even be enclosed 
  beneath the theme by 2022.</p>
<h1 style="font-size:35px">Root</h1>

<p align= justify>Midday meal scheme refers to the government of India programme introduced in all government elementary
schools to provide children with cooked lunch. Tamil Nadu was the first state in India to introduce 
this scheme. The first school which had the scheme since 1925 was Sourashtra Boys Higher Secondary 
School, Madurai. On 28th November 2001, the Supreme Court asked all state governments to begin 
this programme in their schools within 6 months. The programme has shown many positive effects. 
Mothers who used to earlier stop their work to feed their children at home, 
no longer need to do so now.</p>
  <h1 style="font-size:35px">Execution</h1>
  <p align= justify>The Akshaya Patra Foundation, which was successfully implementing its own school lunch programme
  in Karnataka since 2000, was called in to give testimonies for verifying the efficacy of the scheme
  following which the mandate to implement Mid Day Meal Scheme was passed.</p>
  <p align= justify>In order to successfully carry out this mandate, each State Government started its own 
  Mid-Day Meal Programme with Akshara Dasoha being initiated by the Government of Karnataka.</p>
  <h1 style="font-size:35px">Mid Day Meal Menu</h1>
 <p align= justify>The MDM Scheme has many potential benefits: attracting children from disadvantaged 
  sections to school, improving regularity, 
  nutritional benefits, socialisation benefits and benefits to women are some that have been highlighted.</p>
  
  <p align= justify>Studies by economists show that some of these benefits have indeed been realised. 
  The positive effect on enrollment of disadvantaged children, 
  on attendance, on learning effort, 
  on improving nutritional inputs, and on improving nutritional outcomes.
  Caste based discrimination continues to occur in the serving of food, though 
  the government seems unwilling to acknowledge this.</p>
  
<p align= justify>Media reports also document the positive effect of the programme for women, 
  especially working women and its popularity among parents, children and teachers alike. 
  Media reports have also highlighted several implementation issues, including irregularity, corruption, hygiene, 
  caste discrimination, etc. A few such incidents are listed below:</p>
  <h1 style="font-size:35px">Conclusion</h1>
  <p align= justify>At Akshaya Patra, the menu is designed and implemented after taking into consideration various 
    factors, including regional palate, taste, and flavours. Menu diversity is achieved by using a 
    wide variety of seasonal vegetables and locally available ingredients. We have adopted a cyclic a
    pproach with preference to local palate. For example, we serve Sukhdi in Gujarat, Dalma in Odisha, 
    and Bisibelebath in Karnataka.</p>
